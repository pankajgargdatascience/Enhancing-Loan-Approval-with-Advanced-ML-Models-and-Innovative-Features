# Enhancing-Loan-Approval-with-Advanced-ML-Models-and-Innovative-Features

**OBJECTIVE** : To create an advanced machine learning model for accurately predicting loan approval decisions by incorporating innovative features such as the EMI/NMI ratio, Loan to Income ratio (LTIR) aiming to improve the efficiency and accuracy of loan approval processes, enable better decision-making, and reduce the risk of default.

**MODELS USED** : Logistic Regression also incorporating Undersampling, Oversampling, and SMOTE techniques, Random Forest Classifier (both with and without Optuna hyperparameter optimization), and Naive Bayes. Used techniques like Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), Permutation Importance, and Theil's U for feature selection to improve model performance.
